# Bootstrap Toasts
- **Objective :** learn how to use the Bootstrap toast component.

### Preface
The toast component is newly introduced in Bootstrap 4.

They are lightweight notifications similar to push notifications that are shown by web browsers on computer screens.

They're built with flexbox, so you can easily align and position them on a web page.

Additionally, toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, like tooltips, so you must initialize them yourself with **`toast()`** method. Also, toasts will automatically hide after 500 milliseconds (0.5 second), if you do not specify **`autohide: false`**.

With these bunch of examples demonstrating the Tabs
concept and its features in real action.
