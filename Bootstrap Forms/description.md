# Bootstrap Forms
- **Objective :** learn how to create elegant forms with Bootstrap.

### Preface
HTML forms are the integral part of the web pages and applications, but creating the form layouts or styling the form controls manually one by one using CSS are often boring and tedious.

Bootstrap greatly simplifies the process of styling and alignment of form controls like labels, input fields, selectboxes, textareas, buttons, etc. through predefined set of classes.

Bootstrap provides three different types of form layouts:

- Vertical Form (default form layout)
- Horizontal Form
- Inline Form

With these bunch of examples demonstrating the Form concept and its features in real action.
