# Bootstrap Typeahead
- **Objective :** learn how to create typeaheads with Bootstrap.

### Preface
The typeahead input fields are very popular in modern web forms. The main purpose of using typeahead is to improve the user experience by supplying hints or a list of possible choices based on the text they've entered while filling a form or searching something — like the Google instant search.

Typeahead functionality also saves time and reduces the number of potential errors, because the user has less likelihood of making a spelling mistake. Typeahead plugin has been dropped from the Bootstrap (v3.0+), in favor of using Twitter typeahead.
